# UOAnimTools
This is a set of tool created to make less painfull work with new UO anims.
It is in very early stage and needs many improvements, but u can already do many awsome anims with this in few minutes.

I am not programmer. I did this just thx to openai chat. Don't expect a clean code or best performance. Any suggestion or issue just create an issue on github.

Thx for @prapilk for the help. Axis are very confusing.

NOTES:
.Only work with anims extracted with mulpatcher.
.All frames need to be in company of respective liste.txt
.Only work with .PNG files, could be done to work with .bmp but I think it is better this way for many reasons. There are 2 tools to convert the files from on file to another very fast.
.There are more tools done, will be added once they are fixed or improved to be more friendly with new users.
.USer_INTERFACE.PY is recommended or to use "idle", as u will be able to check logs with the errors and prints. Otherwise cmd will close as soon it ends or get error.
.Combine this tool + photoshop's actions and u will be able to create awsome stuff.
.Converters will set background to black and transparent.
