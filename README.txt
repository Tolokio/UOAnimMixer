
This is a set of tool created to make less painful to work with Ultima Online Anims.

It is very recommended to work using User_Interface.py or idle as u will be able to check logs and see whats is going wrong.
First of all is to create folders. So dclick on create folders file or menu button.

The rest of the tools are very intuitive, just fill proper folders with proper anims and use the proper tool.

[FOLDERS]
-ACONVERTER-> Put here .bmp or .png files to convert them.(will overwritte on same folder)
-ANIM1->Put here .png files + liste.txt
-ANIM2->Put here .png files + liste.txt
-OUTPUT->New frames.png + liste.txt will be saved here. (will overwritte if OUTPUT is already filled)
-TEMPLATES->unnused yet.

[Tools]
Each .py file does what names says it going to do.
For it, u need to put frames+list.txt into specific folder.
Then u can dclick on each .py, use the "user_interface.py" or use idle

ANIM1+ANIM2.py Paste anim2 into anim1
ANIM1-ANIM2.py Remove ANIM2 from ANIM1
ANIM1-A2Contorn.py Remove ANIM2 transparent pixels from ANIM1
Create_Folders.py Check if folders are created and create them if not. Use it if u rename Output or any folder.
Convert_PNG/BMP -> Will convert any .png or .bmp from ACONVERTER's folder.
